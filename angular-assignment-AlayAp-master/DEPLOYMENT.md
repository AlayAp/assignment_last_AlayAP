### 🚀 Running the Application

The application runs successfully in development mode:

```bash
ng serve
# Application available at http://localhost:4200
```

**Note**: There's a build issue related to Yarn PnP configuration in the parent directory that prevents production builds, but the application works perfectly in development mode.

## 🔧 Deployment Options

Due to the build issue (Yarn PnP conflict), here are alternative deployment strategies:

### Option 1: Clean Project Creation
1. Copy the `src/` folder to a new Angular 18+ project
2. Copy `package.json` dependencies
3. Build and deploy normally

### Option 2: Development Server Deployment
Deploy using the development server for demonstration purposes:
```bash
ng serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4200
```

### Option 3: Fix Build Issue
Remove the conflicting `.pnp.cjs` file from parent directories:
```bash
# Find and remove .pnp.cjs files
find ../../../.. -name ".pnp.cjs" -delete
```

### Option 4: Use Different Build Tool
Try using Vite directly or create a new project without SSR:
```bash
ng new angular-feedback-app --routing --style=css --ssr=false
```

## 🌐 Recommended Hosting Platforms

1. **Netlify**: Drag-and-drop deployment with automatic CI/CD
2. **Vercel**: Perfect for Angular applications with zero configuration
3. **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for open-source projects
4. **Firebase Hosting**: Google's hosting solution with good Angular support

## 📊 Production Build Commands

Once the Yarn PnP issue is resolved:

```bash
# Production build
ng build --configuration production

# The output will be in dist/angular-feedback-app/browser/
# Deploy this folder to your hosting provider
```
